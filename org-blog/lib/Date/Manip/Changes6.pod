=head1 NAME

Date::Manip::Changes6 - changes in Date::Manip 6.xx

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This describes the changes made to the Date::Manip module in the 6.xx
series of releases.  Major changes are marked with asterisks (*).

For the most part, Date::Manip has remained backward compatible at
every release, but occasionally, a change is made which is backward
incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).

=head1 VERSION 6.32

=head1 VERSION 6.31  (2012-03-01)

=over 4

=item Added extended formats to printf method.

These include the %<A=NUM>, %<a=NUM>, %<v=NUM>, %<B=NUM>, %<b=NUM>,
%<p=NUM>, and %<E=NUM> formats.  Chris Jackson

=item Can now parse formats where the time and zone are not adjacent

A string like 'Jan 21 17:13:27 2010 -0400' can now be parsed.  Requested
on perlmonks ('Can Date::Manip parse a unix timestamp' thread).

=item Added PeriodTimeSep config variable.

This allows you to use a period as a time separator.  Ed Avis

=item Holidays can be used as date strings

You can now parse a holiday name in the Date::Manip::Date::parse method.
For example, parse('Christmas').  Requested by Abigail.

=item Added new recur modifiers

Added WDn, IBD, and NBD modifiers.

=item Added a new date format

You can now parse '2nd day in May' formats. Randy Harmon

=item More flexibility in parsing timezones with both offset and abbrev

If you include both the offset and abbreviation in the timezone portion
of a date, the parenthesis around the abbreviation are now optional, so
you can parse both:

   -04:00 (EDT)
   -04:00 EDT

Requested by Steven Melendez.

=item Deltas now support fractional values.

You can now use a delta of 1.5 days.  RT 42699

=item Multiple holidays supported

A date may now have multiple holidays.  Keith Minkler

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where abbreviations were not being examined case insensitively.
Jurgen Muck

The Holidays section may be safely split across multiple config files.
A bug prevented this from working before.

=item Language fixes

The Norwegian translation was broken due to a typo in the language module.

Included complete documentation for each language.

Fixed a couple problems with Danish.  Nicholas Oxhaj

Added Finnish (from a VERY old mail that I overlooked somehow).  Iikka
Virkkunen

Cleaned up the values used by printf directives to give the expected
result.

=item Documentation fixes

Fixed a typo.  Nicholas Bamber

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.30  (2012-01-11)

=over 4

=item B<(*) (!) Reworked deltas>

Much of the delta code was reworked.

The constraint that a day is treated as 24 hours was removed (by
adding the concept of semi-exact deltas) to better handle daylight
saving time calculations.

Made cosmetic changes to which signs will be included in a delta to
make the deltas more readable.  Signs which are the same as the next
higher field will be omitted, even if they cross set boundaries.

Added support for non-normalized deltas.  See the $no_normalize
option for the parse and set methods.

Removed limitations on subtract=2 not working with business
calculations.

Thanks to discussion on perlmonks, and RT 65774 that prompted me to do
this.  I'd been wanting to do it for some time, but the discussion on
perlmonks made me realize that this needed to be much higher priority.

=item B<(!) Modified Delta_Format>

In conjunction with the above work, added the 'semi' mode to
Delta_Format.

=item B<(!) Removed some deprecated config variables>

The following config variables have been removed.

   GlobalCnf
   IgnoreGlobalCnf
   PersonalCnf
   PersonalCnfPath
   PathSep

   Internal
   DeltaSigns
   UpdateCurrTZ
   ConvTZ
   OldConfigFiles
   ResetWorkDay

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2011n).  RT 71595

Corrects a bug where +0000 and -0000 offsets were not parsed correctly.
Aaron Hall

The zoneinfo data includes rules more than 20 years in the future, so we
now store 30 years of future dates instead of 20 to catch these rules.

When parsing the timezone portion of the date, timezone abbreviations
now take higher precedence than zone names (since that is how timezone
information is typically specified).  That only impacts dates where
the a timezone name is the same as an abbreviation, such as 'CET'.

Previously, a date with CET in it was interpreted as in the CET timezone.
Now it is interpreted as in a timezone with the CET abbreviation.

=item Better handling of undef in DM6

The date/delta parsing routines in DM6 will now handle an undef argument
without issuing a warning.  Earl C. Ruby III

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug with the parse_format %f and %i formats.  Tommi Rintala

Fixed a bug where the Date::Manip::Delta::set function didn't work
to set the month value.

Fixed a bug where parsing some dates near during a DST change failed.

Minor bug fix when using Delta_Format.  Prompted while investigating
RT 41095.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.25 (2011-08-31)

=over 4

=item Relaxed one constraint in ISO 8601 dates

A time separated by whitespace from the date can use a single digit hour.
Yuming Philip Xiang

=item B<(*) Set official removal dates for old config variables>

Config variables will be removed 2 years after they are deprecated (except
for the TZ variable which, due to it's wide use, will be kept for 4 years).

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2011i)

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.24 (2011-06-13)

=over 4

=item New features

Spaces are ignored in the SetDate/ForceDate config values.  Zsban Ambrus

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where 'in one week' wasn't correctly parsed.  E. M. Shtern

Fixed a bug where options passed in to the 'new' as a listref weren't handled
properly.  Zsban Ambrus

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2011g)

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.23 (2011-04-15)

=over 4

=item B<(!) Renamed one Date::Manip::Recur method>

The Date::Manip::Recur::base method has been renamed to basedate .  The
Date::Manip::Recur::base method should return the Date::Manip::Base object
like all the other Date::Manip modules.

=item B<(*) Reworked holidays defined as recurrences>

Improved dealing with the bootstrap problem of defining holidays, especially
those that contain business day flags.  Mike Tonks

=item New features

The printf function will now take multiple format strings and return a list
of values.  Zsban Ambrus

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where GlobalCnf wasn't working.  Peter Edwards

Improved error messages in a few cases.

Fixed a bug where one invalid date/timezone check was ignored.  Morten Bjornsvik

Fixed a bug where '$base2 = new Date::Manip::Base $base1' wasn't working.  RT 67143

Fixed a bug where passing dates in to the Recur->dates method failed.  RT 67144

Fixed a bug where the mode wasn't being preserved correctly for a delta.  RT 67150

Fixed a bug in recurrences where a base date outside of a date range with a very
uncommon recurrence format would not work correctly.

Fixed a problem where the '%s' printf option didn't work in GMT.
Jean-Michel Hiver

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2011f)

=item Documentation fixes

Fixed two bad recurrence examples in the documentation.  Peter Edwards
and Mike Tonks

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.22 (2011-03-07)

=over 4

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2011b)

Fixed a bug where the gmtoff method of getting the local timezone was broken.
Martin Zinser.

Fixed the 'env' method of determining the local time zone to allow the
value to be an offset of seconds since UTC.  This allows the VMS
SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL variable to work correctly.  Martin Zinser.

Removed the SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE method from VMS since the value stored there
is not the name of a timezone (it's a rule in a non-standard format).  Based
on discussion with Martin Zinser.

Improved the order in which aliases, abbreviations, etc., are tested
to test current usage before non-current usage (there were a few cases
where old usages were getting tested before current usage.

=item Language fixes

The module will now die if a language module cannot be loaded (most
likely due to a YAML::Syck issue).  Based on discussion with Martin Zinser.

=item Documentation fixes

Added a sample config file document.  Based on discussion with Rich Duzenbury.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.21 (2011-01-10)

=over 4

=item New features

Deltas may now contain spelled out numbers, so 'in 2 weeks' and 'in two weeks'
will both work.  Daniel Shahaf

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where week_of_year didn't work in some cases.  Chris Eveland.

Fixed a minor potential bug.  Geraint Edwards.

=item Time zone fixes

Updated windows time zone aliases.  Daniel Harding

=item Language fixes

Added Norwegian.  Glenn Sogn

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.20 (2010-12-01)

=over 4

=item B<(*) (!) Reworked recurrences>

Recurrences were reworked in a (slightly) backward incompatible way to
improve their usefulness (and to make them conform to the expected
results). Most recurrences will work the same as previously, but a few will
differ. Most of this was suggested by Jay Jacobs.

A recurring event is now calculated relative to the base date, NOT relative
to a previous event. For example, if a recurrence occurs every month, and
the base date was Jan 31, then previously, recurring events would have
been (in a non-leap year):

   D(0)                   = Jan 31
   D(1)  = D(0) + 1 month = Feb 28
   D(2)  = D(1) + 1 month = Mar 28
   ...

The new behavior is:

   D(0)                       = Jan 31
   D(1)  = D(0) + 1*(1 month) = Feb 28
   D(2)  = D(0) + 2*(1 month) = Mar 31
   ...

Previously, if a base date were not specified, it was not determined
from the date range. Now, the start date of the date range acts as the
base date.

The meaning of the base date has changed slightly. It is much more
meaningful and useful now.

Added iterator functions.  Daniel LaLiberte

The RecurNumFudgeDays variable is no longer used and is deprecated.

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2010o)

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.14 (2010-10-20)

=over 4

=item B<(*) Date::Manip 5.xx fully integrated with 6.xx>

Date::Manip 5.xx and 6.xx are both installed automatically, and the
correct one will be chosen.

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where recurrence handling was broken.  RT 62128

=item Documentation fixes

A lot of documentation was cleaned up to be easier to read, and better
organized.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.13 (2010-10-13)

=over 4

=item New features

Added the input methods to Date::Manip::Date and Date::Manip::Delta.  Ed Avis.

The 'date +%z' command will also be used to determine the timezone.  Oliver Schulze

=item Bug fixes

Several changes to try to get rid of a memory leaks reported in RT
54937.  Huge thanks to BrowserUK on perlmonks for help.  Unfortunately, it
ended up being a bug in perl, and will only be resolved when that bug is
fixed. See the Date::Manip::Problems document for more information.

   Reorganized Base/TZ to get rid of circular references.
   Added end blocks to clean some global variables.
   Got rid of switch/given structures.

Fixed a bug where an incomplete date with 'last' in it was causing an
error.  RT 60138

Fixed a bug where 'Sunday, 9th Jan 1972' wasn't parsed correctly.  RT 57832

=item Time zone fixes

Fixed a bug where Zones.pm was generated with the abbreviations in the wrong
order.  Amish Chana.

=item Language fixes

French month abbreviations now support periods.  Bernard Haerri

=item Test fixes

Added tests from RT 29655 to make sure that the problem never recurs.

=item Documentation fixes

Fixed documentation problem with the new_* methods in Date::Manip::Obj.  Options
must be passed in as \@opts rather than @opts.

Cleaned up some of the documentation.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.12 (2010-09-27)

=over 4

=item B<(!) IntCharSet config variable deprecated>

With better support for international character sets, the old IntCharSet
config variable (which was a bandaid at best) is deprecated. Currently, the
functionality still exists, but it will be removed at some point.

=item New features

Added the Encoding config variable.

Now supports parsing the EXIF date format.  Rhesa Rozendaal

=item Bug fixes

Fixed Build.PL to not require perl 5.010 since the distribution as a whole
does not require that (and I want that fact to be in META.yml).

Fixed a bug where the Date::Manip::Date::set method was broken when setting
individual fields.  Helmut A. Bender

Fixed a bug where set didn't work in Date::Manip::Delta. Patch provided in
RT 59096.

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2010m)

=item Language fixes

B<(*) Converted all language files to UTF-8 and added rudimentary support for
character encodings. Some assistance by Stephen Ostermiller.>

Fixed problem in Polish, Dutch.  Stephen Ostermiller

Extended support for 'nth' up to 53rd.  Paco Regodon

Added some corrections to German.  Dieter Lange

=item Documentation fixes

Clarified Date::Manip::Recur documentation based on RT 59132.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.11 (2010-04-30)

=over 4

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a problem in Build.PL that had an incorrect module requirement.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.10 (2010-04-29)

=over 4

=item B<(*) Combined 5.xx and 6.xx releases into one distribution>

Because the automatic module management tools cpan/cpanp would try
to upgrade Date::Manip to the most recent version, and the most
recent version will only work if perl 5.10.0 or higher is installed,
both the 5.xx and 6.xx releases are now combined into a single
distribution.

This is described more fully in the Date::Manip::Problems document.

=item B<(!) Zones specified by offset>

In all operations involving time zones, the time zone must be determined.
By default, it would take all of the information available (date, ISDST,
etc.) and determine the most likely time zone. It would take every time zone
that matched each piece of information, starting with those that matched
in a standard time followed by those that matched in a daylight saving
time.

When zones are specified by an offset, a standard time would always match
since there are standard time zones that match all year long (the military
time zones A-Z and the standard time zones of the form Etc/GMT+01). As a
result, a daylight saving time match would never occur.

Since (if the date falls during a daylight saving time period) you usually
want to use a time zone that has that offset in daylight saving time,
the default is now to check daylight saving time zones first, followed
by standard times.

See the Date::Manip::TZ manual (under the zone method) for more
information.

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where Date_ConvTZ not working correctly with time zones
specified by offset.  Chris Butler

Fixed a bug where business mode calculations involving minutes was not
handled correctly.  Damien Moore

Fixed a bug where business mode calculations failed in some cases.  RT
56638

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2010i)

Changed Date::Manip::TZ::zone so "dst" is sometimes the default
$dstflag.  Based on the bug report by Chris Butler.

OpenUNIX puts a colon at the start of some time zones. It's removed.
Jean Hassler

=item Test fixes

Converted tests to Test::Inter

=item Documentation fixes

Fixed a documentation bug in Date::Manip::TZ where "stdonly" was
listed as the default value for $dstflag, but in actuality, "std" is
the default.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.07 (2010-02-05)

=over 4

=item Bug fixes

Fixed bug in Date_TimeZone where it wasn't returning the time zone.
Robert Eden

=head1 VERSION 6.06 (2010-02-05)

=over 4

=item Bug fixes

Minor bug where %Z printf format didn't always work.

Added support for 5pm back in (it was omitted accidentally).  Mark Kennedy

Fixed a minor warning.  Morten Bjoernsvik

Some additional speedups.

=item Time zone fixes

Newest zoneinfo data (tzdata 2010b)

Added dm_zdump example script.

Improved TZ::periods functionality

Fixed bug in Date_ConvTZ where empty values weren't defaulting to local time zone.
Robert Eden

Fixed a couple of problems in the generated time zones for some odd
cases (America/Resolute and Asia/Tehran).

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.05 (2009-12-09)

=over 4

=item B<(!) %z format>

In Date::Manip 5.xx, the %z format in UnixDate printed the offset in
the form -0500. In 6.00, I changed that to -05:00:00, but this broke
RFC 822 compliance.

I've changed %z back to -0500, and introduced a new format (%N) which
returns -05:00:00.

Incidentally, this is the LAST unused letter, so I am now going to
have to either stop adding formats, or add some extended format
syntax. Not sure yet which, but this may involve a backwards
incompatible change in the future.

=item B<(*) Significant speedups.>

Thanks to Moritz Lenz and BrowserUK on perlmonks for suggestions (and
a number of other people on perlmonks for suggestions that I did not
end up using, but which provided a great discussion).

=item Bug fixes

Fixed a bug in parse_date where the current time was getting used
instead of the documented 00:00:00

Bug fix where DateCalc didn't work with $mode in some cases.

Fixed Makefile.PL/Build.PL to handle Win32::TieRegistry requirement.

Changed %z printf behavior back to 5.xx and added %N format. Gilles
Lamiral

Added dm_date example script.

=item Time zone fixes

Fixed bug where non-English Windows versions didn't get the
time zone. Thanks to Rene Schickbauer for testing.

=item Test fixes

Reduced the precision of 1 test to avoid a rounding difference when
using a perl compiled with uselongdouble.  Andreas Koenig

Corrects a backward incompatibility with UnixDate. Rene Schickbauer

=item Test fixes

A couple more corrections to the tests.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.02 (2009-11-24)

=over 4

=item Bug fixes

Disabled curr_zone_methods when taint checking on. I believe that Date::Manip
is completely taint friendly at this point.

=item Test fixes

A quick fix to make sure that the tests run correctly in other time zones.

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.01 (2009-11-23)

=item Bug fixes

B<(*) Fixed a bug where dates were sometimes getting the wrong time zone when
SetDate/ForceDate in effect.>

=back

=head1 VERSION 6.00 (2009-11-23)

Date::Manip 6.00 is a total rethink of the module, and a nearly complete
rewrite. Please refer to the Date::Manip::Changes5to6 document for a list
of incompatible changes.

=over 4

=item Reorganization

B<(*) Massive reorganization and near total rewrite.>

B<(*) Broke into several smaller modules>

=item New Features

B<(*) Full time zone support (using tzdata 2009s)>

Added some functionality (suggested by James Elson to improve setting
the "current time".  Done with the ForceDate config variable.

B<(*) Converted languages to YAML for much easier maintenance. Patch and
suggestion provided by Evan Carroll>

Added much better formats for deltas. Suggested by Jim Hranicky.

Borrowed the _FindWindowsTZName function from the DateTime-TimeZone
module.

Added SetDate config variable (based on a suggestion by Christian Campbell).

Added parse_format which was first suggested by Kim Ryan.

=item Other changes

Several config variables deprecated

Thanks to Jonathan Hogue for helping test Windows additions.

=item Bug fixes (correcting problems in the 5.xx releases)

Fixed a bug where "YYtoYYYY=c" wouldn't work.

VMS bugfix to not call `date` command.  Lane

New Year's Day defined using a recurrence which might push the observed
day to the previous year was broken. Reported by Jerry Wilcox.

=item Language fixes

Fixed typo in Turkish translation.

Spelling fix in Dutch. Bart Van Loon

=item Additional credits

I have received many suggestions over time which were automatically
handled during the 6.00 rewrite. Although the changes weren't made
because of the suggestions specifically, I wanted to acknowledge
them since I appreciate the suggestions.

I believe the first person to suggest writing Date::Manip as an OO
module was Eduard Derksen.

Delta_Format initialization done outside of the function.  Eric Boehm

Added $subtract to calculation routines. First suggested by Steve Berlage.

Added ability to set individual parts of the date (Date::Manip::Date::set).
First suggested by Martin Thurn.

UnixDate (i.e. Date::Manip::Date::printf) only calculates formats when
they are needed.  Eduard Derksen

Parsing will skip some date/time formats if requested. This was first
suggested by Eduard Derksen.

It has been suggested several times to support multiple languages,
multiple config files, or multiple sets of Date_Init
options. These suggestions (by Meng Fang, Ed Avis, Christian
Campbell, and perhaps others) were at the back of my mind as I
developed the Date::Manip::Base class.

The regular expressions are all i18n friendly in anticipation of much
better support for localization. First suggested by Alex Kapranoff.

Parsing a date ('today', 'Monday') gives a time of '00:00:00'. Suggested
by Mark Aitchison.

Working with fractional days was suggested by Peter van Hardenberg.
This is implemented in Date::Manip::Base::day_of_year method.
