=head1 NAME

Date::Manip::TZ_Base - Methods common to the TZ and Base classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Date::Manip::TZ_Base class is a second base class used for the
following Date::Manip classes:

   Date::Manip::Base
   Date::Manip::TZ

This module is not intended to be called directly and performs no
useful function by itself. Instead, use the various derived classes
which inherit from it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains no public methods and is used internally by
the Base and TZ classes. In some instances, if the two classes
were completely separate, a Date::Manip::Base object would depend
on a Date::Manip::TZ object creating a circular reference which I
wish to avoid.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

None known.

=head1 BUGS AND QUESTIONS

Please refer to the Date::Manip::Problems documentation for
information on submitting bug reports or questions to the author.
